Main aspects to analyze:
- City 
- Penalties about traffic issued by the city (‘polizia municipale’ or city police)
- Processes
    - Issue, monitor status, receive payment, follow up (in case of no payment)
    - Automatic issuing (cameras at traffic lights, at ‘ZTL’ / limited access zones, at speed checks)
    - Parking fees payments and parking tickets
